IMPORTANT: Firebase Realtime Database Rules Setup

The user data is not being saved because Firebase Realtime Database has default security rules that DENY all writes.

To fix this, you MUST update the Firebase Realtime Database Rules:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Your Project
2. Go to Realtime Database
3. Click on "Rules" tab
4. Replace the current rules with the following:

{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid || root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('userType').val() == 'admin'",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "riders": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "clients": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid || root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('userType').val() == 'admin'",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}

5. Click "Publish" to save the rules

EXPLANATION OF RULES:
- Users can write to their own user data (users/{uid})
- Riders data is readable by all authenticated users (for finding riders)
- Clients data is only readable by themselves or admins
- Each user can only write to their own data path
- This ensures security while allowing user registration to work

After setting these rules, the user data will be saved to Realtime Database in the proper structure when signing up.
